  <h1>Happy Birthday, My Love!</h1>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Chapter 1: START OF A BEAUTIFUL STORY AND JOINING OF TWO SOULS</h2>
    <p>It was New Year's Eve, and this boy was thinking that something special might happen this year—something valuable. Life had been constant for a while, and he had gotten used to it, so he assumed it would be something related to his career. Little did he know, something much bigger was on its way. Time passed, and he waited eagerly for that moment to arrive, wanting to savor it, but it was still just January, and the entire year was ahead. He told himself, "I'll wait," but deep down, he knew something life-changing was going to happen.

        Meanwhile, there was this girl—always searching for love. She started looking on Instagram, knocking on doors to find someone who would love her the way she longed for, something she had never truly experienced. She was tired and bored with life, and her family often irritated her, knowing how sensitive she was to everything. Though she pretended to be tough and act like she didn’t care, deep down, she was a fragile soul, fighting for herself.
        
        One evening, while the boy was busy with exams, trying to cope with life and feeling exhausted, his phone buzzed with a message. He ignored it at first, then later checked, realizing it was from some random girl. Tired of dealing with new people, especially women, he initially didn’t want to reply. But, listening to his heart, he decided to respond, only to find the message was gone. He then asked her, "What’s the matter?" expecting to be ignored, but to his surprise, she responded. And just like that, they began a conversation, unaware of what was starting.
        
        As they got to know each other, he was struck by her energy and way of talking, but only thought of her as a friend. She, however, was on a different mission. She spent time getting to know him, and he answered her honestly, as he always did. Months passed, and their texting became routine, like any normal friendship. She shared her past with him, saying he reminded her of someone she had once been close to. He took it as a compliment, though he often wondered why she kept telling him such things when they barely knew each other. The girl was trying to convince him that he was the one, but he, being a bit oblivious, dismissed it every time, thinking it was nothing.
        
        At that time, the boy was exhausted by life and by relationships, already caught in a one-sided situation. When she first showed frustration and threatened to leave, saying he had betrayed her, she quickly returned, too emotionally fragile to walk away. She listened as he explained his side, and the boy, unknowingly attached to her, didn’t want her to leave, not even as a friend.
        
        As time passed, they began sharing more personal things, believing it was just part of a normal friendship. But deep down, they were developing feelings for each other, something they hadn’t expected. He started noticing how upset and possessive she got when he went off the radar for a few days. She was extremely sensitive, and her mood often depended on how he treated her. It became clear to him that she had feelings for him, but he didn’t want to acknowledge it yet because he wasn’t someone who fell in love easily. She dropped hints, trying her best to show him that he was the one, but he remained clueless.
        
        One evening, during their usual chat, the girl finally gathered all her courage and confessed her true feelings. She revealed how she believed this young man could be the one to heal her, to nurture her, and bring life back to the barren desert she felt inside. She confessed that she loved him, hoping he would accept her.
        
        The boy was still confused, but he was happy she had finally opened up because, deep down, he too had feelings for her. Despite this, he wasn’t ready to accept her love right away. His response left her concerned and slightly disappointed, but she was determined to fight for him, believing that’s what love is all about. Over time, the boy started to reflect on her confession, wondering if she could be the one he had been searching for all along. However, he was still unsure about how a long-distance relationship would work, so he decided to give himself more time to think. He didn’t want to hurt someone so close to him, knowing the decision was critical—he either had to take a leap or walk away. With these thoughts weighing on him, he went to sleep.
        
        As the girl subtly tried to influence him, the boy began to reconsider his decision. Over time, he started going with the flow, and eventually, everything fell into place. Without any formal acceptance or proposal, they moved forward, and gradually, they both became more immersed in each other's lives. This marked the first stage of love. The girl would often chatter about random things, while the boy, now falling in love, listened affectionately. They were happy, but their story had just begun. Like any relationship, the highs and lows were yet to be discovered.
        
        At this stage, everything seemed beautiful—the way they spoke, the way they looked at each other. This was the time when love was developing, and nothing else mattered. It was the beginning of everything: love, healing, and appreciating the beauty of one another. It all happened during Ramadan, the boy’s favorite month. As they passed the time while fasting, they supported each other—she would wash dishes, and he would head to prayers. They would chat briefly before she went to sleep, and he would return before Sehri, where they would hurriedly greet each other and tackle their chores. After Fajr, they even played Roblox together.
        
        These moments were some of the best times of their lives. Despite being incredibly sleepy, the boy stayed up as the girl would insist, he not sleep until she was done. He, yawning, would listen to her endless chatting, content with the happiness they shared. From the boy's perspective, everything seemed perfect. But from the girl's side, there was something missing—something she never voiced, as she was the type who believed if he truly wanted to do something, he would. Unaware of this, the boy simply enjoyed the month, and together they completed the first chapter of their love story

  <div class="section">
    <h2>Chapter 2: THE TEST OF LOVE</h2>
    <p>This marked the beginning of the second chapter, the most difficult phase for both of them. Before this, they had experienced one of the most beautiful nights together—it was Chand Raat, the night before Eid. That night felt magical for both of them. While she was applying henna, he stayed up chatting with her the entire night. Normally, she would sleep early, so spending the night together felt like a dream come true. She typed with one hand, and he listened attentively to her chatter. They shared an intimate closeness through texts, almost like they were cuddling in a digital world. As the night passed, they both felt happiness bloom, excited to celebrate their first Eid together. But after Eid, due to issues with her device, she wasn’t able to be online as much, which subtly began to affect things.

        A few days after Eid, the girl started to feel frustrated. Though they had minor arguments before, this time it felt more serious—something deeper was bothering her. She started voicing concerns that she had never mentioned before. The boy was caught off guard, fearing what had changed her so suddenly. She told him that, although she still loved him, she couldn’t continue the relationship any longer, saying she felt like she had wasted her time. This revelation shocked him—how could she feel this way when, from his perspective, he hadn’t done anything wrong? He suspected her friends had influenced her decision, as he knew sometimes girls rely on their friends' opinions. Despite acknowledging some of his own mistakes, he believed these issues were things they could work through, not reasons to tear them apart.
        
        The girl, feeling frustrated and overwhelmed, wanted to end things, while the boy, confused and hurt, kept asking what he had done wrong. He tried his best to reason with her, to make her understand their connection and that it was worth saving. But sometimes, when someone's mind is set, it's hard to turn things around. They didn’t speak for a few days, and during that time, both of them fell ill with a fever, which felt like a physical manifestation of the emotional turmoil they were going through.
        
        When they reconnected, the girl was still distant, cold even. She wasn’t interested in saving the relationship and wanted to walk away. But the boy, determined not to lose her, managed to convince her to stay, promising to change for her. He assured her that while he doesn’t fall in love easily, once he does, he is committed to making it work and won’t give up easily. He changed his approach, becoming more loving and attentive toward her, but things still weren’t fully back to normal.
        
        About a week later, influenced by her friends again, she ignored him for two days, thinking he might give up. But she underestimated the depth of his love for her. Little did she know that a man truly in love won’t be swayed by such tactics. He was willing to accept any fault, any situation, and do whatever it took to save the relationship. He wasn’t like the typical guy who would give up so easily. Then, just as he thought things were improving, she hit him with another shock—this time due to family pressures, she said it was pointless to continue their relationship. He understood her reasons but was still heartbroken. Together, they made the painful decision to let go of each other and return to being friends, as they had been before. For the boy, this was an incredibly difficult decision, but sometimes, true love means letting go.
        
        As time passed, they continued talking as friends. Then, out of the blue, her feelings for him reignited. She surprised him with heartfelt paragraphs, something unusual and rare from her. She expressed her desire to love him again, and although the boy had his doubts, thinking she might ask him to leave again, he couldn’t resist. He accepted her love once more, though he asked her to promise not to let outside issues affect them again. She agreed, and they fell back into their relationship.
        
        This phase was by far the most testing for both of them, but especially for the boy, who often felt he had no choice but to go along with her decisions. It was a phase that either makes or breaks couples. Despite knowing they were entering uncertain territory, they both faced it bravely, making their love even more special. By now, they had learned that no external fight or issue could break them apart—their connection had deepened, and their hearts, minds, and souls were more in sync than ever. The distance between them wasn’t a hindrance; it only made their bond stronger. The girl had stopped listening to her friends’ advice and instead started following her own heart. Since then, things between them had been much better, without the unnecessary assumptions or misunderstandings that once clouded their relationship.
        
        Together, they entered the third and final stage of love: acceptance. In this phase, they were truly happy, full of energy and optimism, moving forward together with everything they had carried on their shoulders until this point. They had endured the storms, and now they were stronger, closer, and more committed than ever, ready to face the future together.

    <h2>Chapter 3: THE UNBREAKABLE BOND OF TWO LOVERS</h2>
    <p>The third stage of our relationship was truly beautiful, a mesmerizing journey of love. By this point, we had both changed, and we knew we weren’t going anywhere—no matter how much we fought or how many times we questioned our love, we were determined not to give up on each other. Even when Ashi would block me, I somehow saw it as a sign of how deeply she loved me, though it was also my greatest fear—waiting for her without any contact. But I always had faith that no matter what happened, she would come back. 

        Both Ashi and I had become more aware of our own flaws, and we accepted them. She was incredibly possessive about me, and I felt the same way about her when it came to her talking to her friends. But the most important part was that we always managed to work things out. In any relationship, there’s always a balance—when one person is angry, the other needs to be calm and understanding. She was my "Miss Angry," and I was her calmness. I understood her sensitivity, knowing that even a single word at the wrong time could trigger her. That’s why I was always careful with my words, often typing slowly, making sure nothing I said would hurt the one I loved most. 
        
        For me, Ashi was everything. I was ready to do anything for her, just like a man in love does for the woman he adores. And although my mistakes may not have been big enough to cause issues, I understood her possessiveness and anger. For her, it was justified—she was my queen, and it didn’t bother me how she reacted or what she said. When a man truly accepts a woman into his life, she should be free to express her thoughts, desires, and even anger. Only then does her true love and spirit flourish. I gave her that freedom, and she discovered sides of herself—her love and even her anger—that she hadn’t known before. 
        
        It was beautiful to see how we grew together and how our lives impacted each other. She had so much energy—one moment she was one way, and the next, she was something entirely different. It was incredible. While I sometimes acted like a baby around her, she was the one who was really the baby—demanding like a baby, getting angry like a baby, and asking me to fulfill her little wishes. And I gladly did, because I loved her. 
        
        This stage of our love wasn’t without its ups and downs. We still had arguments, not full-blown fights, but disagreements. Her anger issues were real, and even small things could set her off. But, as I mentioned before, we were opposites—she might be disappointed one day, and after a few apologies from me, she'd be back to her loving self. She just needed validation, someone to calm her down and make her feel secure again. 
        
        So, with these little ups and downs, we continued happily, enjoying every moment together. Then came one of the toughest moments for her—her illness. This was the most beautiful part of our journey for me, but also the hardest for her. I’m glad I was there for her through all her ups and downs. Her illness took a toll on her, leaving her exhausted and frustrated. Every five minutes, her mood would drop, and she'd send me the same message over and over. I wasn’t irritated by it; I was worried, wondering how I could support her emotionally since I couldn’t be there physically. The distance between us made it harder. 
        
        Her periods were delayed, and she was constantly anxious. She was relieved when they finally started, but her joy quickly faded when they wouldn’t stop. The pain, cramps, and frustration were overwhelming, but somehow she managed to cope—after all, she’s my strong "Pookie." Things got worse as days passed, and she began to worry that her illness was stopping her from loving me properly. But I didn’t care about that—I reassured her constantly that her existence was all that mattered to me. I knew she loved me, and I made sure to remind her of that so she wouldn’t overthink it. 
        
        I was her emotional support when she was at her lowest, praying for her daily and reminding her how proud I was of her. She drew motivation from my words, and I was careful to use that motivation in the right way. I became her reminder for her medicines, like her personal alarm clock. After about a month, she finally recovered, and it was the happiest day of my life. I wish she could’ve seen how much joy I felt. I did share some of my happiness with her, but I wanted her to be there with me to truly experience it. It had been a tough journey, but together, we made it through.
        
        However, during her illness, something even more significant happened—something I had predicted. After we reunited post-breakup, I knew that we would eventually part ways. It was in the last week of August that my fate was sealed. She told me that she wanted us to stay together only until our birthdays. I was shocked—birthdays weren’t important to me; she was. But I knew that even if I asked her to stay, she would say no. So, despite my own pain, I agreed. That’s what love is—doing what makes the other person happy, even if it hurts you. 
        
        From that point onward, every day was tough. Talking to someone you know you’re about to lose is like knowing when you’re going to die, just like a cancer patient counting their final days. But I gave her every last ounce of my love in those remaining months, even though it was filled with sadness for me. She wasn’t as shocked as I was—she had already made up her mind. Though it was difficult for her too, her circumstances made it harder for her to continue. For me, it was completely unexpected. 
        
        Relationships like ours come once in a lifetime, but sometimes reality hits hard, and in our case, the distance killed what we had. We loved each other to the very end, but it’s hard to keep loving someone when you know they’re going to leave. We didn’t break up because of personal issues or fights, but because of the circumstances between us. Despite the pain, I continued to love her with all my energy, pretending to be happy for her. At least I had the chance to experience some precious moments with her. Our journey may have ended, but the love we shared will forever remain in our hearts, along with the memories. 
        
        We promised each other that I would always be her "first husband," and she would always be my "first wife," deep down in our hearts. And we kept that promise. It was difficult to keep going, especially with my work piling up and knowing she would soon be gone, but I tried to give her as much time as possible. As for the future, I don’t know what the next few months will hold. This was our life—our love, our days, and everything in between. I couldn’t have asked for anything better. We had the best moments—Chand Raat, Ramadan, our fights, our breakup, Eid, and being together through her tough times. It all happened so fast, and I can hardly believe it. 
        
        We were once addicted to each other. She even told me, “You’re like a drug I’m addicted to,” and so was I  
        This was our story, the major one. I don’t know how the next months will be, but these were the main events of our journey, and what we meant to each other. I always let my ego down for her and allowed her to be herself, even when I didn’t do much to hurt her. It was usually her anger that made her feel things deeply. I was aware that I never did anything too bad to break her heart, 
        
        In love, I’m willing to sacrifice everything, even my own needs. and I’m happy I showed her what true love, care, and happiness are, especially after what her previous relationship lacked. She used to tell me she was over her ex, but she still compared me to him sometimes. That was the hardest part—to know that she loved him first. I don’t believe in the idea of "first love" being the ultimate one, but I do believe it leaves a lasting impact. While first love stays in your memory, for me, true love is the person who stays with you forever and ultimately it becomes your first love.
        
        I was still happy to have had a gem like her in my life. I gave her so much advice that she probably found boring, but I knew those lessons would help her become a better person. She already had a good heart, always helping others and doing things for people, not just for me. But I was the one who consoled, motivated, and supported her when she was down. 
        
        As they looked ahead to the next chapter in their journey They talked about the little things they would save up for each other—the stories, the inside jokes, the small treasures of daily life that they would one day share without rush. And though they were apart, they found happiness in knowing that they were always with each other in spirit, connected by the gentle assurance that love like theirs only grows with time. They were bound by a faith in their future, a belief that every day brought them one step closer to the life they both desired.
        
        And so, they carried on with cheerful hearts, filled with dreams of a future where they would come together, stronger and happier than ever before. They knew that when the time was right, all their waiting, their laughter, and the love that had grown quietly across the miles would unite them. It was only a matter of time until their dreams aligned and they became one, living out the love story they had always believed in.
        
        For now, they lived each day with joy, grateful for the journey that awaited them—a future they were building not alone, but together, step by step, with unwavering hearts and a love that promised them everything they could ever wish for.
